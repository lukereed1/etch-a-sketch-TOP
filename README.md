## General Info

Another project within the Odin Project curiculum, this is an Etch a Sketch web program where the user is able draw on a virtual canvas. It allows the user to draw in black (default), a color of their choice or rainbow mode where colors are randomly generated for them. There is also an eraser button and a reset button which allows them to start over on a blank canvas. Project build using HTML, CSS and Javascript.

## Goals

The main aim of this project was to practice DOM events and manipulation. Also to practice writing code in a manner which is neat and concise, making comments where necessary so I understand what's going if I look back on it in the future.
